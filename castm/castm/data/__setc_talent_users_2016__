This summer I also participated in a directing workshop at The Old Vic in London. I have been in many productions all over South Carolina.,"While working with Shakespeare Carolina I stage managed for two summers. At the Rose Theatre Kingston I was a technical intern and learned everything from proper maintenance of lights to how to run one of the largest international theatre festivals in the world. While there I handmade battle axes and shields to be used in the Trevor Nunn production of ""War of the Roses"". I was a directing intern at Carolina Actor's Studio Theatre. I am also currently directing a children's play at New Prospect Elementary in Inman, South Carolina. One of my other many projects is creating my own nonprofit theatre company for my final senior project. 100% of the proceeds are going to charity. I am writing, directing, and performing in my first show to benefit alzheimer's.
