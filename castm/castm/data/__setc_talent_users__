The program was a rigorous combination of class study combined with hands on experience. I completed a series of classes that focused on different acting techniques created by such teachers as Stanislavski, Hagen, and Meisner. I also received course study on different acting styles ranging from Classical Greek and Shakespeare to Absurdism. In addition to studying styles and techniques, I also went through several levels of voice and movement intensives. Outside of the acting realm, I have studied voice under professional voice teachers for four years. I have also completed 2 years of tap dance training and reached an intermediate level of application. After graduation I regularly attended an advanced classical scene study with Yale MFA Graduate, Andi Chapman. I studied with her for a year.","While I attended my university, I was fortunate enough to be able to perform for the theater that was attached to the school. During my time there I performed in nine mainstage shows, earning a lead or supporting role in every one of them. After school, I auditioned for and gained acceptance into a professional theater company in Hollywood, CA where I was able to perform along side other professional actors of all ages. I also co-founded a theatrical company called Split Check Entertainment. We have produced several plays and short films. Since graduation I have also been hired repeatedly as a professional director for a children's theater that runs out of my hometown in North Carolina. In the technical aspects of theater, I have also been hired as a scenic designer and painter for several theatrical companies and organizations around my hometown.",20141031111637_5453b5e529a59.jpg,,Azusa Pacific Univer,BA,01/05/12,Already Graduated,"Ah, Wilderness",Wint,Acting,Actors Co-Op,323-462-8460,Rachel Tracie,rtracie@apu.edu,Azusa Pacific University,,,,,Christopher,,Speed,4025 Old Salisbury Rd,Kannapolis,NC -

I studied at Diana Evans School of Dance for 14 years. That is where I began performing. As I grew older, I discovered I was a natural actor and singer. In high school, I joined choir and did every musical I could. I took private lessons with Johanna McCarty Rogers for three years. I also took acting classes. I studied with Hollywood Actor Steve Zahn and his wife Robyn for two years, all the while I continued to dance. I went away to college at Belmont University as a musical theatre major where I extensively studied classical voice and took acting classes. After a year, I transferred to Northern Kentucky University where I switched my major to acting. I focused more on acting training. I am a part the Comedy and Improv Troupe and of course the Dance Troupe. I also continue to take vocal lessons with Joshua Steele. At NKU, I have a healthy dose of everything.",I have worked on light crew for a few shows at my university. This mainly entailed setting up the lights on the grid and taking them down. I have also worked in the scene shop helping build the sets for various shows.,20150122123917_54c143d56c9e9.jpg,,Belmont University,BFA,01/05/12,Left without Graduating OR Not a Degree Program,Failure: A Love Story,Ensemble,Acting,Northern Kentucky University,8595726362,Ken Jones,jonesk@nku.edu,northern Kentucky University,,,,,Andrew,,Wiemann,3741 Horsemint Trl,Lexington,KY - KENTUCKY,40509,,awiemann@insightbb.com,"1992, 8, 23",Male,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Northern Kentucky,BFA,01/05/16,Will graduate in future year,The Heidi Chronicles,Peter Patrone,Acting,Northern Kentucky University,8595726362,,,,,,,,Andrew,,Wiemann,3741 Horsemint Trl,Lexington,KY - KENTUCKY,40509,,awiemann@insightbb.com,"1992, 8, 23",Male,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Spamalot,Sir Bors/Ensemble,"Acting, Dancing, Singing",Northern Kentucky University,8595726362,,,,,,,,Andrew,,Wiemann,3741 Horsemint Trl,Lexington,KY - KENTUCKY,40509,,awiemann@insightbb.com,"1992, 8, 23",Male,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,South Pacific,Professor,"Acting, Dancing, Singing",Northern Kentucky University,8595726362,,,,,,,,Andrew,,Wiemann,3741 Horsemint Trl,Lexington,KY - KENTUCKY,40509,,awiemann@insightbb.com,"1992, 8, 23",Male,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A.
